# DmML: Machine Learning for Data Migration Optimization  

## Overview  

**DmML** is a machine learning-based performance model designed to enhance **data migration efficiency**. It predicts key metrics like **transfer time and resource allocation**, enabling better decision-making and cost savings in large-scale migrations.  

## Motivation  

Traditional data migration methods can be inefficient, requiring manual estimations that are often inaccurate and resource-heavy. **DmML leverages ML models to automate predictions, improve scalability, and minimize costs and delays.**  

### Objectives  
- Develop an **ML model** to predict **data transfer time** and **resource usage**.  
- Validate the model using **IBM Db2** as a real-world case study.  
- Provide insights for **optimizing migration configurations**.  

## Case Study: IBM Db2  

**IBM Db2** was selected due to its **high performance and scalability**. The **Db2 Migration Service** was used to test migration strategies, ensuring **secure and efficient data transfer**.  

## Methodology  

1. **Environment Setup** – Simulated **Db2 instances** inside **Docker containers**.  
2. **Data Generation** – Used **TPC-H benchmark data** and **DMBench** for migration scenarios.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Focused on **data size, system resources (CPU, RAM), and migration parameters**.  
4. **Model Training** – Tested multiple ML models, with **XGBoost emerging as the best performer**.  
5. **Validation** – Used **statistical tests** and **SHAP analysis** to assess model reliability and interpretability.  


## Explainability & Recommendations  

### System Configuration  
- **Allocate sufficient RAM** to avoid bottlenecks.  
- **Increase parallel streams** to speed up migration.  

### Data Optimization  
- **Use efficient compression methods (e.g., GZIP, LZ4)**.  
- **Balance row distribution** to improve transfer efficiency.
